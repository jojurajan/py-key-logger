py-key-logger
=============

Trying to make a key logger in Python. Initial research :) is done. Now comes the hard part. Coding and making sure the code works.
Update: Made the keylogger. Right now it just makes a file named output.txt in the same folder as the py file. It works on my linux sytsem but I am not sure about other linux systems. Need to check that out.
